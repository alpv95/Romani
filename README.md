# Synchrotron and SSC Polarization of Blazars
Python and C code to calculate the SED and polarization of relativistic conical jet of electrons and positrons initially in equipartition with power law $\alpha$ and an exponential cutoff. Model described in apj1 and apj2. The free parameters are: jet power  $W_j$, initial electron power law $\alpha$, the electron energy exponential cutoff $E_{max}$,  initial magnetic flux density $B_0$, relativisic bulk gamma $\Gamma_{bulk}$, observation angle $\theta_{obs}$ and jet opening angle (jet frame) $\theta_{op}$.
